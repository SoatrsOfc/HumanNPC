HumanNPC Plugin ✨

Description 📜

The HumanNPC plugin allows server administrators to spawn custom NPCs in their Minecraft server. These NPCs are human-like entities that can have skins based on the player who spawns them. The plugin uses a simple API to create NPCs with player skins, making it easy to create interactive NPCs with your server's players.

Features 🌟

Spawn NPCs with Player Skins 🧑‍💻: Players can spawn NPCs that have the same skin as them!

Customizable NPCs 🧑‍🎤: The plugin allows for NPC customization and future expansion with more mobs.

Easy to Use 🔧: Simple commands to spawn NPCs.

Next Update 🚀: The plugin will soon support spawning other mobs, expanding beyond human-like NPCs.


How to Install ⚙️

1. Download the HumanNPC.phar file from the releases section.


2. Place it in the plugins folder of your PocketMine-MP server.


3. Restart the server to enable the plugin.



How to Use 🛠️

Spawn an NPC: Players can use the following command to spawn NPCs with their skins in-game:

Command: /npc create <name> [invisible]

Replace <name> with the name of the NPC you want to create.

If you want the NPC's name to be invisible, add the optional invisible parameter.


Example command: /npc create Steve invisible


Future Updates 🔮

Support for spawning different types of mobs (zombies, skeletons, etc.).

More customization options for NPCs.
